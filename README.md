## Big Data, Fast Data: Using Spark and PySpark to Scale Data Insights

We live in an age awash in data. More data was created in the past two years than in all the years prior. Yet less than half a percent of all data created is ever analyzed. Part of the reason for this neglect is sheer scale. You can't simply download the Internet and open it in an Excel spreadsheet! 

Making sense of data at scale requires a paradigm shift, referred to as Big Data. What are the appropriate tools for analyzing and harnessing Big Data? How is Machine Learning (ML) done with Big Data? What is Fast Data? 

In this one-hour session, Data Science expert and trainer Dr Ra Inta answers these questions and discusses how to manage the pain points your organization may experience while scaling up your data operations. Join us to learn how your teams can:

*	Understand what makes data Big (Ra’s article, [How Big is the “Big” in Big Data?](https://www.accelebrate.com/blog/how-big-is-the-big-in-big-data/), is also a great resource if you want a head start!)
*	Gain an overview of the Big Data ecosystem
*	Understand how data management operates with Spark and PySpark
*	See how Machine Learning is implemented in Spark ML
*	Grok the concept and promise of Fast Data
*	See how Spark Streaming and Apache Kafka combine to produce a real-time alert system

Follow along with downloadable code, or just come for the entertainment! At the conclusion, Ra will hold a Q&A session and eagerly answer your questions.

Audience: Anyone wanting to learn about Big Data, Machine Learning, and data management. No prior experience is presumed, however, the sections on Machine Learning and Streaming with Kafka will get a little technical at times.
